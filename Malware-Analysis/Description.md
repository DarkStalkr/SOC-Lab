## The techniques used take into account the following:

Time-based Detection:

The code checks if time is being manipulated (a common sandbox technique to speed up analysis)
It compares actual elapsed time against expected time
Sandboxes often accelerate time to analyze time-delayed malware faster


System Resource Analysis:

Checks CPU count and memory size
Sandboxes often use minimal resources to conserve computing power
Real systems typically have more resources than sandbox environments


Environment Checks:

Looks for suspicious hostnames
Checks for common sandbox-related paths
Examines running processes for analysis tools


Process Detection:

Searches for common analysis tools like Wireshark or Process Monitor
These tools are often present in analysis environments but rarely on regular user systems
